# Spring-Boot-MySql-Multiple-Data-source
This project is an example of how to set up Spring Boot to work with two independent MySql databases  Note, that this example is not about JTA transactions spanning multiple databases but rather just interacting with separate databases through a cleanly separated domain model and Spring Data repositories.
